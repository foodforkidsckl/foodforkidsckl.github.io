        	<h1>Welcome to Food For Kids City of Kawartha Lakes!</h1>
                        <h2>Mission and Vision</h2>
            <p>Food For Kids works to ensure all children and youth have access to healthy, nutritious, safe, and personally acceptable food to optimize their learning at school.</p>
            <h2>About Food For Kids CKL</h2>
            	<p>Established in 1999, Food For Kids is a non-profit community   partnership that works to ensure  all children attend school well   nourished as well as promoting healthy eating  habits in our children   and youth.  There are currently 48 Student Nutrition Programs operating in 31 schools within the City of Kawartha Lakes that serve thousands of studnets daily.  Food  For Kids is continuously working on expanding current   student nutrition  programs and making those programs more accessible to   students.  These efforts are made possible through the  continued   support of community  members, local businesses, and service clubs who   contribute funds or donate  nutritious food and other supplies.  Student   nutrition  programs engage many people in local communities by working   closely with  organizations and individuals in the communities.  Student   nutrition programs would not be  possible without the commitment and   dedication of those who take the time to  volunteer their time by   shopping for groceries, preparing food, or serving  meals.  In doing so,   volunteers are also  showing children and youth that their communities   care.  It is because of the many kinds of community  support that   student nutrition programs are made possible.</p>
            
            <h2>Meet the Food For Kids Steering Committee!</h2>
            <p>Food For Kids CKL is governed by a Steering Committee with representatives

            <h2>Who Do We Serve?</h2>
    			<p>There are currently 48 student nutrition programs in all 31 schools in the City of Kawartha Lakes serving over 10, 000 students  every day in both the public and Catholic school boards, as well as the Boys  &amp; Girls Club.</p>
            <h2>Why Do We Serve?</h2>
                <blockquote>
      				<p>When a child&rsquo;s stomach is empty everything else   is  secondary. Before developing a thirst for knowledge and hunger for   learning one  must first satisfy the body&rsquo;s own thirst and hunger.</p>
                    <ref>Romeo LeBlanc,  former Governor General of Canada</ref>
    </blockquote>
            <p>Research shows   that  nutrition has a direct impact on a student's ability to learn and   perform in  school.</p>
