            <h2>Importance of Student Nutrition Programs</h2>
  <p>Children who have not eaten have difficulty concentrating in  school. Hungry children are easily distracted, lethargic, and as a result,  often cause disruptions in class.   Teachers consistently note that Student Nutrition Programs improve their  students&rsquo; ability to pay attention, concentrate on their lessons, exhibit good  behaviour, and attend classes more often.  Student  Nutrition Programs in City of Kawartha Lakes are universal, and all children  are welcome to participate in their school&rsquo;s nutrition program.</p>
                <blockquote>
      				<p>When a child&rsquo;s stomach is empty everything else   is  secondary. Before developing a thirst for knowledge and hunger for   learning one  must first satisfy the body&rsquo;s own thirst and hunger.</p>
                    <ref>Romeo LeBlanc,  former Governor General of Canada</ref>
    </blockquote>

      <h2>Why Do Children Go To School Hungry?</h2>
      <p>•  Insufficient food in the  home<br />
        •  Hurried morning routines<br />
        •  Long bus rides to school<br />
        •  Lack of parental  supervision at mealtime<br />
        •  Child is not hungry  before leaving for school<br />
        •  Families have developed  the habit of not eating breakfast<br />
        •  Students who eat early in  the morning are often hungry again before school begins<br />
      •  Students involved with  early morning practices and rehearsals often need to &ldquo;top up&rdquo;</p>

      <h2>Objectives of Student Nutrition Programs</h2>
      <p>•  To ensure all children in  City of Kawartha Lakes attend school well nourished and ready to learn<br />
        •  To support the healthy  development of children and youth<br />
        •  To promote healthy eating  habits among children and youth<br />
      •  To create healthy  eating environments in schools</p>
