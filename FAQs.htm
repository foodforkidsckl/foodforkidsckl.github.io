         	<h2><a name="Funding" id="Funding"></a>How are School Nutrition Programs funded?</h2>   
            <p>The Ministry of Children and Youth Services provides base funding to all student nutrition programs.  All schools must do independent fundraising to cover the remaining costs of their program.</p>
            <p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
            
            <h2><a name="WhoAreWe" id="WhoAreWe"></a>Who is Food For Kids?</h2>
            <p>Food For Kids is a non-profit community partnership that works to ensure all children attend school well nourished as well as promoting healthy eating habits in our children and youth. Food For Kids is continuously working on increasing the number of program volunteers and community supporters, securing financial donations, and expanding current programs to make existing nutrition programs more accessible to students.</p>              
            <p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
            
            <h2><a name="WhoIsInvolved" id="WhoIsInvolved"></a>Who is involved?</h2>
            <p>Student nutrition programs are run by volunteers, including parents and guardians, community members, school staff, administration, and the students themselves.   Individuals in the community, local businesses, and service clubs contribute funds and donate healthy, nutritious food and other supplies.</p>              
            <p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
            
            <h2> <a name="TypeOfFood" id="TypeOfFood"></a>What type of food is served?</h2>
            <p>Each school has a unique nutrition program that works for their environment. The type of program at the school (breakfast, morning meal, snack or lunch) will impact the menus and food offered.  Many schools serve fresh fruit and vegetables, peanut-free granola bars, cheese, yogurt, muffins and bagels.</p>              
            <p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
            
            <h2><a name="CanAnyFood" id="CanAnyFood"></a>Can any food be served?</h2>
            <p>Schools must strive to meet regulations set by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services, which has provided <a href="http://www.children.gov.on.ca/htdocs/English/documents/topics/schoolsnacksandmeals/nutrition_guidelines_2008.pdf" title="Nutrition Guidelines developed by the Ontario Ministry of Children and Youth Services" target="_blank"> Nutrition Guidelines for Student Nutrition Programs</a> that outline nutrition facts and recommended foods.  In addition, Trillium Lakelands District School Board has a <a href="http://tldsb.ca/parents/health-and-wellness/nutrition-in-schools/?layout=item" title="TLDSB Nutrition Policy" target="_blank"> Nutrition Policy</a> which nutrition programs must adhere to.  Food For Kids monitors the nutrition programs and collects quarterly reports on menu selections and food being served.</p>

            <h2><a name="WhoPartcipates" id="WhoParticipates"></a>Who is allowed to participate in School Nutrition Programs?</h2>
            <p>Nutrition prgrams are for <strong>EVERYONE!</strong></p>
            <p>Nutrition programs are universal and available for ALL children and youth to access, regardless of socio-economic background.</p>              
            <p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
            
            <h2><a name="Affiliations" id="Affiliations"></a>Is Food For Kids affiliated with the Haliburton Kawartha Pine Ridge District Health Unit?</h2>
            <p>While Food For Kids receives support from the HKPR District Health Unit, Food For Kids is not affiliated with the Health Unit.  Food For Kids is an independent, non-profit, community partnership.</p>              
            <p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
            
            <h2><a name="WhyImportant" id="WhyImportant"></a>Why are student nutrition programs so important?</h2>
            <p>Hunger influences children's behaviour and ability to participate, focus and learn in school.  Romeo Leblanc, former Governor General of Canada, described it best:
             <blockquote>
      				<p>When a child&rsquo;s stomach is empty everything else   is  secondary. Before developing a thirst for knowledge and hunger for   learning one  must first satisfy the body&rsquo;s own thirst and hunger.</p>
                    <ref>Romeo LeBlanc,  former Governor General of Canada</ref>
    </blockquote>
    </p>              
    <p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
    
    <h2><a name="HowMuch" id="HowMuch"></a>How much of my donation will go towards purchasing healthy food and supplies?</h2>
    <p>One hundred percent of each donations will be put towards purchasing healthy food and supplies for students in City of Kawartha Lakes.  Food For Kids' administrative costs are covered by the Ministry of Children and Youth Services.</p>
