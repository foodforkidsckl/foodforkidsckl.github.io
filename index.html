        <h1>Welcome to Food For Kids City of Kawartha Lakes!</h1>
            <h2>Who Are We?</h2>
            	<p>Food For Kids CKL is dedicated to supporting local student nutrition programs.  Unlike national programs which spread donation dollars across Canada, Food For Kids CKL puts your donations to work in the communities where you live.</p>  
                <p><b>One hundred percent</b> of your donations to Food For Kids are used to support student nutrition programs in City of Kawartha Lakes.  Your donations go directly to helping schools purchase healthy and nutritious food as well as kitchen supplies.</p>
                <p>Every school in City of Kawartha Lakes has a student nutrition program, which includes 31 schools in Trillium Lakelands District School Boards, Peterborough Victoria Northumberland and Clarington Catholic District School Board, and the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Kawartha Lakes.</p>
         
        	<h2>Did You Know?</h2>
            	<p>The purpose of Student Nutrition Programs is to <b><span style="color:red"> support learning and healthy development</span></b> because when a child is hungry, everything else is secondary.</p>
                <p>SNPs are universal and available for <b><u>all</u></b> students to access, regardless of their socio-economic background.</p>
                <p>Programs are free of judgement and free of charge.</p>
                <p><i>The most important meal of the day is when a child is hungry.  SNPs ensure all children have access to healthy food so they can optimize their learning at school.</i></p>
            <h2>For more information about SNPs, visit <a href="NutritionMatters.htm">Nutrition Matters</a></h2>
                
        	
            
        <h1>Student Nutrition Programs are for EVERYONE!</h1>
            <h2>What You Need To Know:</h2>
            	<p>Student Nutrition Programs are universal, free of charge, and available for all students to access, regardless of their socio-economic background because every child has the right to access healthy and nutritious food at school so they can learn to their full potential.  There are currently 48 Student Nutrition Programs operating in <strong>all</strong> 31 schools throughout the City of Kawartha Lakes.</p>  
          	<h2>Why Your Support Is Needed</h2>
       	<p>The Ministry of Children and Youth Services provides base funding to all programs annually, but schools rely on community support to fill in the remaining gaps.  By supporting local student nutrition programs, through donations and volunteering, you are investing in the children and youth in our community and are providing strength and sustainability to these important programs.  Volunteers and community partnerships help to ensure that students learn to their fullest capabilities, are able to focus in class, regulate their behaviour, attend school more often, and learn life-long healthy eating habits.
</p><p><strong><span style="color:red">Giving back to our community by supporting student nutrition programs will help ensure a healthy successful future for our children.</span></strong></p>
